Developed a hand gesture recognition model using near-infrared images from the Kaggle Hand Gesture dataset. The dataset comprises ten different gestures performed by ten subjects. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained to classify gestures, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and potential use in gesture-based control systems.
